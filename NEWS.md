### DataExplorer 0.3.0
#### New Features
* [#25](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/25): Added `SetNaTo` to quickly reset missing numerical values.
* [#29](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/29): Added `DropVar` to quickly drop variables by either name or column position.

#### Bug Fixes
* [#24](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/24): `CorrelationDiscrete` now displays all factor levels instead of contrasts from `model.matrix`.

#### Enhancements
* [#11](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/11): Functions with return values will now match the input class and set it back.
* [#22](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/22): Added documentation for **num_all_missing** in `SplitColType`.
* [#23](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/23): Added additional measures (in addition to frequency) to `CollapseCategory`.
* [#26](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/26): Removed density estimation section from report template.

#### Other notes
* [#30](https://github.com/boxuancui/DataExplorer/issues/30): In `CollapseCategory`, `update = TRUE` will only work with input data as `data.table`. However, it is still possible to view the frequency distribution with any input data class, as long as `update = FALSE`.
